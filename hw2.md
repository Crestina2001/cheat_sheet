No.

The following code is used to generate fictitious data, and we find the number of grid units are 53 in both original and transformed data:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Generate synthetic data: a simple 2D dataset
mean = [0, 0]
cov = [[1, 0.8], [0.8, 1]]  # Diagonal covariance
data = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 300)

# Define a function to calculate the number of grid units
def count_grid_units(data, grid_size):
    # Round data points to nearest grid point
    rounded_data = np.floor(data / grid_size)
    unique_points = set(tuple(point) for point in rounded_data)
    return len(unique_points)

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
data_transformed = pca.fit_transform(data)

# Define grid size (each unit size, e.g., 0.5 x 0.5 grid)
grid_size = 0.5

# Count grid units in original and transformed data
original_grid_units = count_grid_units(data, grid_size)
transformed_grid_units = count_grid_units(data_transformed, grid_size)

# Print the results
print("Number of grid units covered in the original data: ", original_grid_units)
print("Number of grid units covered in the transformed data: ", transformed_grid_units)

# Plotting function with grid lines for visualization
def plot_data_with_grid(data, title, grid_size):
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], alpha=0.5)
    plt.axhline(0, color='grey', lw=1)
    plt.axvline(0, color='grey', lw=1)
    plt.grid(True, which='both', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)
    plt.xticks(np.arange(round(data[:,0].min()), round(data[:,0].max()), grid_size))
    plt.yticks(np.arange(round(data[:,1].min()), round(data[:,1].max()), grid_size))
    plt.xlabel('Dimension 1')
    plt.ylabel('Dimension 2')
    plt.title(title)
    plt.axis('equal')

# Plot original data with grid
plot_data_with_grid(data, 'Original Data with Grid', grid_size)

# Plot transformed data with grid
plot_data_with_grid(data_transformed, 'Transformed Data with Grid (PCA)', grid_size)

# Display plots
plt.show()
```

For a small subspace, suppose there is a dense grid unit. Then we add another dimension, for every point in the subspace, there is a chance that the value in this dimension is very different from other points in the dense unit. In this way, the point will 'leave' the dense unit. Therefore, if more dimensions are added to a subspace, more and more points will 'leave' the dense units, so there is less likely to have a dense unit.

(i)

No. Apriori algorithm requires that all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent, but this does not hold if the threshold varies for different subspace sizes. Here is a counter example: A(1, 2), B(1, 2), C(3, 1), D(4, 2). Suppose the density threshold is 3 for one dimension, 2 for two dimensions, then A and B are in the same dense unit if considering both dimensions, but not when only considering one dimension.

(ii)

If c is larger than 1, we go to the case described in (i), and we cannot adopt Apriori algorithm. While c is smaller than or equal to 1, the requirement that 'all subsets of a frequent itemset must be frequent' holds, we could adopt the algorithm.

Here are the steps:

```
1, Compute dense units L[1] only considering one dimension
2, Compute candidate C[2] by joining L[1] and removing repetitive grid units
3, Compute L[2] by removing grid units whose density is smaller than T2
4, repeat 2 and 3 until L[k]=0
```

(a)

The statement "When the size of the subspace is larger, it is less likely or equally likely that the subspace has a good clustering" is true.

The following lemma holds true:

If a k-dimensional subspace $X_1, â€¦, X_k$ has good clustering, then each of the (k-1)-dimensional projections of this space has also good clustering.

So if a subspace has a good clustering, then any subspace of it must have a good clustering. But reversely, the superspace is not guaranteed to have a good clustering.

**step 1: compute covariance matrix**

After subtracting the mean, the data becomes:
$$
M=\begin{pmatrix}
-1 & 1 & -2 & 2\\
-1 & 1 & 2 & -2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The covariance matrix is:
$$
\Sigma=\frac{1}{4}*M*M^T=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{5}{2} & -\frac{3}{2}\\
-\frac{3}{2} & \frac{5}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
**step 2: compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors**
$$
\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{5}{2}-\lambda & -\frac{3}{2}\\
-\frac{3}{2} & \frac{5}{2}-\lambda
\end{vmatrix}=0
$$
Solve it, then we get:
$$
\lambda_1=4
\\
\lambda_2=1
$$
For $\lambda_1=4$, we have the eigenvector of: $(1, -1)$

For$ \lambda_2=1$, we have the eigenvector of: $(1, 1)$

**step 3: compute transformation for every point**

The transformation matrix is:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
so we could have:

a': $(14+2c, 0)$->select 0

b': $(18+2c,0)$->select 0

c': $(16+2c,4)$->select 4

d':$(16+2c,-4)$->select -4

(ii)

yes.

Transformed points are:
$$
a'=0\\
b'=0\\
c'=4\\
d'=-4
$$
(iii)

The matrix becomes:
$$
M=\begin{pmatrix}
-c & c & -2c & 2c\\
-c & c & 2c & -2c
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
\Sigma=\frac{1}{4}*M*M^T=
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{5}{2}c^2 & -\frac{3}{2}c^2\\
-\frac{3}{2}c^2 & \frac{5}{2}c^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
By the scaling rule, we have:
$$
\lambda_1=4c^2
\\
\lambda_2=c^2
$$
While the eigenvectors remain unchanged:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
-1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
So we have:
$$
a'=0\\
b'=0\\
c'=4c\\
d'=-4c
$$

Original Entropy:

$info(T)=1$

For attribute HasMacBook:
$$
info(T_{yes})=1\\
info(T_{no})=1\\
info(HasMacBook, T)=\frac{1}{2}*1+\frac{1}{2}*1=1\\
Gain(HasMacBook, T)=0
$$
For attribute Income:
$$
info(T_{high})=1\\
info(T_{medium})=1\\
info(T_{low})=1\\
info(Income, T)=1\\
Gain(Income, T)=0
$$
For attribute Age:
$$
info(T_{old})=0.811\\
info(T_{middle})=0\\
info(T_{young})=0\\
splitInfo(Age)=1.41\\
info(Age, T)=0.811*\frac{1}{2}=0.405\\
Gain(Income, T)=(1-0.405)/1.41=0.42
$$
The first split is Age.

For middle age group, Buy_AppleVisionPro is yes, while for young age group Buy_AppleVisionPro is no.

Now we have:

$info(T)=0.811$

For attribute HasMacBook
$$
info(T_{yes})=0\\
info(T_{no})=1\\
info(HasMacBook, T)=\frac{1}{2}*1=\frac{1}{2}\\
splitInfo(HasMacBook)=1\\
Gain(HasMacBook, T)=0.811-0.5=0.311
$$
For attribute Income:
$$
info(T_{high})=1\\
info(T_{medium})=0\\
info(T_{low})=0\\
info(Income, T)=0.5\\
splitInfo(Income)=1.5\\
Gain(Income, T)=(0.811-0.5)/1.5=0.207
$$
So we choose HasMacBook as the second split. If HasMacBook is yes, then AppleVisionPro is yes. While HasMacBook is no, it is uncertain whether AppleVisionPro is yes or no, but it has met the stopping criterion, so we would predict yes as a random guess, because the chances of yes and no are equal.

The final decision tree is: 

```
If age is young, return no;
If age is middle, return yes;
If age is old: 
{
if HasMacBook is yes, return yes;
if HasMacBook is no, return uncertain or yes(if has to choose from yes or no)
}
```

(ii)

age is old and  HasMacBook is yes, the result is yes.

(b)

The C4.5 algorithm divides the information gain by the intrinsic information (entropy) of the feature across potential splits. A feature with high entropy indicates many categories or an even distribution across those categories, which are not desired for splitting.  By using the gain ratio, C4.5 ensures that splits are chosen based not only on their raw information gain but also on how that information is distributed. An extreme example to showcase the intuition of C4.5 is to split using the ID number, which will result in low entropy in every subtree, and thus high information gain, but is actually useless for prediction.
